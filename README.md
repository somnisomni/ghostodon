Because [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) doesn't officially support Mastodon, and [Twitter](https://twitter.com) is [likely to be collapsed](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1621026986784337922) after [a strange rocketman took over the our little bird](https://time.com/6234759/nothing-can-replace-twitter-roger-mcnamee/).
